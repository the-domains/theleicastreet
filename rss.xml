            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>La Brea</h1><p>La Brea between 3rd street and Wilshire is such an amazing walk.

It was an amazing time watching the transition La Brea has taken with much of the religious community holding on to the area. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/53aae042c78fdf925757fc176d51ff004d7a0237.jpg"></article>]]></description>
