            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Inspirations</h1><p>I can not remember a time without having my wife Maureen by my side. We have been together since January 2006 and experienced so much. Without her, I am really not sure where I would be. She has pushed me when I needed it and loved me through everything. We are now proud parents to 2 beautiful children and I can not wait to have more wonderful experiences. Thank you Maureen, I love you. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/22a14a06aad8613790b83e9f6b1506824268bdd6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Starting with Film Photography ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Starting with Film Photography </h1><p>Shooting film photography is described by many as the best way to actually learn about photography. In this instance I believe they are talking about light, which is the most important condition in taking photographs. Without an LCD screen and the ability to machine gun, film does make me slow down and concentrate on not wasting film, which in turn is not wasting money. Learning about light and how to adjust my aperture and shutter speeds based on light condition has made me a better photographer, if your looking to make the jump these are some websites that helped me. And lets be honest we all need motivation and looking at others work only gets me more excited to take more photos.  </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/089d68df9927f120189cbe2b1df48b77fb9ccc45.jpg"></article>]]></description>
