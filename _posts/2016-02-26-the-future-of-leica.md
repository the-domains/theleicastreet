With Leica introducing several new cameras including the M240, M260, M262, Q and SL the direction Leica is heading. Introducing live view has left many wondering if the are moving away from the rangefinder system and traditionalists would argue that Leica is venturing away from what has made them great.

With the simplicity of Leica M cameras people must wonder what does the future hold for Leica. The M system which uses a rangefinder focus system is not for everyone and based on technology that is over 50 years old. Once the focus technique is learned it can be very fast, but most non rangefinder shooters will pass as they are accustomed to auto focus. But this is the beauty and for some the flaw with Leica.

Leica is not one to leave tradition and released the Leica M-A, which is a film camera with no built in meter system and an ode to the Leica M3\. While the M-A was being released and allowed film shooter to grasp the past, Leica also stepped into the technological advancements with the release of the Q. Now when I say advancements some will point to what Sony and other manufacturers have released already, but for Leica this was a huge step. This is a full frame camera in the style of the Sony RX-1\. It has been receiving very good reviews and it may be the step that Leica takes for future endeavors. This has the classic look of a Leica but with some of the modern technologies that people crave. With Leica there is always a catch and that is usually the price tag with the Q coming in at 4300 USD.

So with the next M system what will it have. As [LaVidaLeica wrote][0] earlier this year, the rangefinder system may be changed out. It is expensive and cumbersome to the camera. With everything being made thinner and lighter the rangefinder system may be a deterrent to gaining these advantages. I believe Leica due to price point will always be seen as a luxury item. This is very unfortunate as they make some great cameras. They are built like tanks, but with rangefinder technology it needs constant upkeep. The digital M's also have been found to have sensor issues, which has caused many issues over the years. 

The quality of lenses available have made myself and many others hold on to shooting with a Leica. Lenses from 50 years ago render fantastic images today. This is the dichotomy of Leica, so much quality that comes with many flaws.  

With the advancement of technology many in the forum world have questioned the value of Leica cameras. I for one agree that they are very expensive comparable to Fuji, Nikon, Canon and Sony products. Each of these cameras also have the ability to take amazing pictures. 

So the question remains where is Leica going? I for one, hope it says true to the M line and they keep the tradition of rangefinder cameras.
