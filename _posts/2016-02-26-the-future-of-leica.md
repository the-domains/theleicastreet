With Leica introducing several new cameras including the M240, M260, M262, Q and SL the direction Leica is heading. Introducing live view has left many wondering if the are moving away from the rangefinder system and traditionalists would argue that Leica is venturing away from what has made them great.

The M system is what I believe is Leica's bread and butter. These cameras are built like tanks, but with rangefinder technology it needs constant upkeep. The digital M's also have been found to have sensor issues; but the quality of lenses available have made myself and many others hold on to shooting with a Leica. Lenses from 50 years ago render fantastic images today. This is the dichotomy of Leica, so much quality that comes with many flaws.  

With the advancement of technology many in the forum world have questioned the value of Leica cameras. I for one agree that they are very expensive comparable to Fuji, Nikon, Canon and Sony products. Each of these cameras also have the ability to take amazing pictures. 

So the question remains where is Leica going?
