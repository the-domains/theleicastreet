![I cannot remember a time without having my wife Maureen by my side. We have been together since January 2006 and experienced so much. Without her, I am really not sure where I would be. She has pushed me when I needed it and loved me through everything. We are now proud parents to 2 beautiful children and I cannot wait to have more wonderful experiences. Thank you Maureen, I love you.](https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/13183320_575461795965159_615627587_n.jpg?ig_cache_key=MTI0MjkxNzM0NTg3OTI1MzYxOQ%3D%3D.2)
