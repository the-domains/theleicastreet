When getting into Leica the internet is filled with opinions. Shockingly there are quite a few Leica haters along with those that overly praise the brand. Below I have listed my favorite Leica sites. 

**_1_:**[http://www.l-camera-forum.com][0]. The most complete Leica forum on the web. It has everything you would need to help you discover everything Leica. It has everything: film, digital, lenses, rumors, etc... Follow on twitter @leicaforum

**_2_:**[http://lavidaleica.com][1]. By far the site I follow the most for Leica rumors and news. Always seems to be right on new products and doesn't disappoint with his honest assessments. Follow him on twitter @lavidaleica.

**_3_**: [http://www.imx.nl/photo][2]. If you looking for technical info on Leica cameras and lenses there is not better than Erwin Puts. His expertise is unquestioned. 

_**4**_: [http://blog.leica-camera.com][3]. What would a list be without at least one official Leica site. This blog has been redesigned over the years. Mostly I like reading about different photographers take on Leica equipment and looking at the pictures. Follow Leica @Leica\_Camera

_**5**_:[http://www.stevehuffphoto.com][4]. Last but not least on my top 5 is Steve Huff. Maybe a bit hated across the internet world, but one of the websites that has "real life" Leica reviews over the years. He has been able to review many cameras, but maybe non more popular than his M9 review. Follow on twitter @stevehuffphotos
