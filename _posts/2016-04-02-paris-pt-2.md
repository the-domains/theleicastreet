Like I said in my earlier post about Paris, I love this city. There is something new to be seen every time you visit. Be it walking around the streets, enjoying the amazing historical sites or have an espresso at a cafe, it is always exciting. I can not wait to go back and explore more of this fantastic site. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fa42414124205db552306ab7555df9f8e0f0d835.jpg)
