Leica is EXPENSIVE. I know this is shocking to some, but the price point is inherently high. What you get for your money is the real question. The guys at [Brooklyn Shooters Channel][0] discuss the differences between the Leica M6 and MP. I had to make this choice when starting out and pretty much decided a camera and lens camera.
