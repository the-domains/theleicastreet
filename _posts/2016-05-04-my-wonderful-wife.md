I cannot remember a time without having my wife Maureen by my side. We have been together since January 2006 and experienced so much. Without her, I am really not sure where I would be. She has pushed me when I needed it and loved me through everything. We are now proud parents to 2 beautiful children and I cannot wait to have more wonderful experiences. Thank you Maureen, I love you.
