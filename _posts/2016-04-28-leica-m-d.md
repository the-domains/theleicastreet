description: 'I love this concept of no LCD screen at a cheaper price than the recently released Leica M262. I am not sure I love it at a significantly greater price. The camera itself is beautiful, but from all of the details an M240 with no screen in terms of picture quality. This feels like the last drop from this iteration of the M. I would have loved to if some differences had been applied like weight or size, but alas this is not the case. Leica always comes at a price and this simplicity comes at a price, which is significantly more expensive than a new M262 or a used M240. '

I love this concept of no LCD screen at a cheaper price than the recently released Leica M262\. I am not sure I love it at a significantly greater price. The camera itself is beautiful, but from all of the details an M240 with no screen in terms of picture quality. This feels like the last drop from this iteration of the M. I would have loved to if some differences had been applied like weight or size, but alas this is not the case. Leica always comes at a price and this simplicity comes at a price, which is significantly more expensive than a new M262 or a used M240\.
