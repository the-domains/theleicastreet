La Brea between 3rd street and Wilshire is such an amazing walk. Filled with all kind of interesting stuff from furniture to food to synagouges. I was lucky enough to have lived in the area for 3 years, walking this street every Saturday and Sunday morning. It was an amazing time watching the transition this street has taken with much of the religious community holding on to the area. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d32a80c6-5669-4046-a984-f1999b406530.jpg)
