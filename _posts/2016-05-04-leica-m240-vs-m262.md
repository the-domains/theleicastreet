Getting into Leica digital photography, and having a few thousand dollars to spare. One may wonder should I buy an M240 or M262? This is the question the guys at Brooklyn Street Shooters hope to help you answer. With the used prices for M240 coming way down and hovering around the 4000 USD mark, maybe the decision is to buy a used M240\. Either way watch the video and follow Brennan Mckissick @brennanphotoguy.
