Shooting film photography is described by many as the best way to actually learn about photography. In this instance I believe they are talking about light, which is the most important condition in taking photographs. Without an LCD screen and the ability to machine gun, film does make myself slow down and concentrate on not wasting film, which in turn is not wasting money. Learning about light and how to adjust my aperture and shutter speeds based on light condition has made me a better photographer, if your looking to make the jump these are some websites that helped me. And lets be honest we all need motivation and looking at others work only gets me more excited to take more photos.  

1: [http://www.japancamerahunter.com/][0]. A wealth of information about not only Leica cameras, but all film cameras. This site is amazing and one that everyone needs to frequent.  Follow on twitter @Jpncamerahunter

4:[http://www.ilfordphoto.com/home.asp][3]. Shooting Tri X is probably my preferable black and white film, but in Los Angeles with 2 young children developing my own film is not possible. So lately I have taken to shooting C41 film. This is cheaper for me to get developed and I shoot with Ilford XP2\. Its less grainy than Tri X and has different characteristics, but give it a try and I think you will love it. Follow on twitter @ILFORDphoto

With the recent closing of I Still Shoot Film many will wonder what is the future of film, but with people like the ones listed above and a growing community of film shooters, I do not see film disappearing. It may always be a niche product, but one that will remaining relevant much like vinyl records.
