My name is Scott Johnston and having been a Leica fan for a number of years, I wanted to share my love for Leica with the rest of the world. After recently quitting my job to become a stay at home dad I wanted to explore my creative side and a website and a camera seem like a great place to start. What theleicastreet.com will become I am unsure, but I look forward to sharing things that I find interesting along the way. Thank you for visiting the site and hopefully we can explore photography together.
