My introduction to Leica was through internet reviews around the release of the M9\. After reading people wax poetically about the quality and shooting experience I knew a Leica was in my future. Being able to shoot an M6 since 2012 I feel more equipped to state why Leica make special cameras. 

Simplicity is often stated as a main reason for shooting a Leica and I wholeheartedly agree. Dials are easily displayed and changed rapidly. This making shooting more comfortable for me. A few weeks ago I used my dads Nikon d800 and had no idea what I was doing. This is not the cameras flaw but rather mine and with what I have been accustomed to. You can set dials to your liking and have many settings, with Leica film cameras and to some extent their digital cameras these options are not available and your forced (positive for some, negative for others) into learning how to quickly manage them. I find all I want is shutter, aperture and ISO settings. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2ebad6b02361e69dc549b26140b31ed6f12c5d36.jpg)

Viewfinders of Leica's are fantastic and are big and beautiful with space outside the frame to see what is coming in and out of your shot. Once using a rangefinder in general I would imagine that it is hard to go back to a DSLR. It is not that those are bad viewfinders, but it doesn't compare to a rangefinder. The negative of the viewfinder is that it's an approximation of your frame. I have not had too much trouble with this and can't think of a missed shot because of it. ![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5400159656a9d8818e3d2ce9cec183043dc3387b.jpg)

Focusing with a rangefinder may be difficult at first but once practiced becomes easier. The split image prism is my favorite and probably the most accurate way to focus manually. This along with scale focusing allows for fast focus times and few missed shots.

Lastly the build quality of a Leica just feel substantial, nobody can say they aren't solid camera. The lenses which I have not wrote about and are the best part of using a Leica feel incredible. The compact design and weight are perfect for me. I feel no fatigue in carrying my M6 all day. The same can be said of an M9 with the M240 being slightly heavier. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/80be4209-eda7-44fc-9fdf-378d855897c2.jpg)

With the introduction of Sony's A7 line a lot of people see it as a leader of camera technology. The problem with them is they release a camera every month it seems. Meaning your technology will get old rather quickly. Leica nay sayers will believe Leica uses old tech and their cameras are over priced antiques, but many have not shot with a Lecia to understand the qualities they do have. So give Leica a chance before you write them off and you to will find they have a very special quality that may convert you.
