Besides from [Steve Huffs M9 Review][0] maybe the most influential person in shaping my love for like is Kai Wong. His M9 video review fascinated me and from that moment on I knew that a Leica rangefinder was in my future. Besides from this review Kai is part of the wonderful [digital rev team][1]. You can follow him on twitter @kaimanwong
